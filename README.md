```html
<ul
	class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge is-grid columns-N has-excerpts has-deadline has-scope has-duration"
>
	<li class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item">
		<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-title">
			<a href="URL">Title</a>
		</div>
		<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-meta">
			<time datetime="" class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-deadline">
				Date
			</time>
			<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-scope">Scope</div>
			<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-duration">Duration</div>
		</div>
		<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-excerpt">
			Excerpt
			<a href="URL">Read More</a>
		</div>
	</li>
</ul>
```
